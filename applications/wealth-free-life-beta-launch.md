### Project Description

Wealth Free Life (WFL) is a mobile-first, gasless DeFi platform that enables anyone — including unbanked and underbanked users — to invest, save, and spend crypto effortlessly. The platform uses a proprietary 3-Core Wallet System:

- **Invest Wallet:** AI-driven automated DeFi investing  
- **Save Wallet:** High-yield staking pools with institutional-grade risk logic  
- **Spend Wallet:** Instant, fee-free crypto payments and budgeting

WFL is building the easiest crypto wallet for financial freedom.

This grant covers **Stage 1**: bringing our closed beta into public launch, onboarding 1,000+ users through PR and social growth, and activating visibility in the Web3 ecosystem.

---

### Deliverables

- Open-source React Native wallet modules (DOT-compatible)
- GitHub contracts for Save/Spend flows (testnet-ready)
- Documented integration with a Polkadot parachain (Moonbeam/Substrate-based)
- Analytics report from the open beta campaign
- 3+ Web3-native blog or PR pieces
- AMA + Twitter campaign analytics

---

## Motivation

Billions of people are priced out of DeFi. Wealth Free Life changes that.

This grant brings the platform from private testing to a public-facing open beta, helping us reach real users and integrate with the Polkadot ecosystem via native DOT support.

We aim to use Substrate-compatible modules and deploy bridges for native savings, referrals, and in-wallet spending.
